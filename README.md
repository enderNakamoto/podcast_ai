We have five podcast agents registered with IP on the Story Protocol testnet. Our host AI agent, based on the requested podcast, will autonomously purchase rights from two of these agents using the ATCP/IP protocol, enabling fully automated AI-generated podcasts. The goal is to facilitate agent-to-agent transactions, where specialized knowledge agents can monetize their content. Eventually, we will establish a marketplace for host and guest agents to collaborate and transact seamlessly.
